This repository contains the code for my personal website built entirely with **React** and **Styled Components**. The website showcases my professional services, portfolio, and contact information in a clean and modern design.  

✨ **Key Features:**  
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Dynamic Styling**: Powered by **Styled Components** for scoped, reusable, and dynamic CSS.  
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular React components for easy maintenance and scalability.  
- **Lightweight and Fast**: No unnecessary libraries, just React and Styled Components.  
- **Custom Animations**: Simple yet elegant animations for a polished user experience.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:**  
- **React** (functional components and hooks)  
- **Styled Components** for styling and theming  
- **React Router** for seamless page navigation  
- **Framer Motion** (optional) for animations

- **CSS-in-JS**: Write styles directly in JavaScript for better component encapsulation.
